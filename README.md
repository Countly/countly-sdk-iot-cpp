# Countly C++ SDK for IoT devices

Countly can be used to store sensor data coming from IoT devices. This repository holds all C++ SDKs that can be used by different IoT devices. SDKs also have persistency feature - e.g if data cannot be sent to Countly server, it is saved to be sent later. 

Currently supported devices: 

* Intel Edison with builtin wifi (also supporting [Grove sensors](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove-Indoor-Environment-Kit-for-Intel-Edison-p-2427.html)) 
* Intel Edison with Arduino Oficial Ethernet Shield 
* Arduino Yun
* Arduino with Arduino Oficial Ethernet Shield 
* Arduino with Arduino Oficial Wifi Shield
* Node MCU Esp8266 Devkit v1 and v2 Arduino code
* Arduino/Genuino 101 (Intel Curie Boards) with Arduino Oficial Ethernet Shield

<!-- ## Documentation 

All documentation related to this Python SDK is [located in resources page](http://resources.count.ly/v1.0/docs/iot-devices-python).

If you are very new to C++, or if you are more comfortable using Python, we also have [Countly Python SDK repository](https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-iot-python/) for several supported IoT devices.
